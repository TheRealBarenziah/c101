# C 101
### Notes & playground for JS kiddies such as myself

## Compile into bin (executable)
- I) `sudo apt-get install gcc` 
- II) Write a `foo.c` file
- III) Then in terminal : `gcc -Wall foo.c -o foo` (2)
- IV) Run executable in terminal: `./foo`

## Compile into WASM
- I) `sudo apt-get install python2.7 && sudo apt-get install cmake && sudo apt-get install default-jre && sudo apt-get install git-core`
- II) Get [emsdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#platform-specific-notes)
- III) Put this in your ~/.bashrc: `source $HOME/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh &> /dev/null`
- IV) Return to the path of your `foo.c`
- V) `emcc fibo.c -s WASM=1 -o fibo.html` (1)
- VI) Example incoming

## WASM looks awesome but C makes me cry. I'm a JavaScript kid just like you. What to do ?  
[AssemblyScript][15] seems to be perfect for you: the power of WASM without the hassle of learning a new language  

## asm.js
Old (out of flavor since WASM) and unrelated, but imo it can still be interesting for JS devs trying to get closer to the machine.  
While TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, asm.js is a subset of it. Basically you have to forget Objects, Strings and other fancy stuff and work with only three data types:  
- int: 32 bit integer type  
- double: 64 bit floating point type  
- float: 32 bit floating point type  
So at the end, your application basically becomes a giant JavaScript array of numbers and pointers to these numbers index.  
Afaik it is meant to be generated by compilers (Emscripten) from C/C++. Pretty much a precursor of WASM, I like the fact that [it can still be written by hand][13].  
Tho it seems to require [a level of masochism so high, you better learn C straight away][14].

(1): Assuming you're in correct path. `-Wall` will display all Warnings, `foo.c` is target file, `-o foo` will output an executable named `foo`  
(2): `fibo.c` is target, `-s` tells *emcc* to generate LLVM bitcode, `WASM=1` WASM=true, `-o fibo.html` output an HTML file named fibo (could also be `fibo.js`)

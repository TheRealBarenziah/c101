### Notes & playground for JS kiddies such as myself

[Quick link to Mr. Srinivas's lessons about C][17]. I can't thank this man enough for his awesome pedagogy and the fact he let it be free for everyone.  
**Namaste**: the divine in me bows to the divine in you. भगवान आपको आशीर्वाद दे और आपको हमेशा संतुष्ट और खुश रखे. Thanks again sempai <3

## Compile into bin (executable)
- I) `sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential manpages-dev` 
- II) Write a `foo.c` file
- III) Then in terminal : `gcc -Wall foo.c -o foo` (2)
- IV) Run executable in terminal: `./foo`

## Compile into WASM
- I) `sudo apt-get install python2.7 cmake default-jre git-core`
- II) Get [emsdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#platform-specific-notes)
- III) Put this in your ~/.bashrc: `source $HOME/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh &> /dev/null`
- IV) Return to the path of your `foo.c`
- V) `emcc foo.c -s WASM=1 -o foo.html` (1)
- VI) Example incoming

## C Resources
[C as in Caterpillar][8]  
[The Bible][9]  

## WASM Resources
[80% of good stuff is recensed here][4]  
[Remaining 20% on Medium articles or Stack Overflow][5]  
[WAT (WebAssemblyText, the human-readable version of WASM)][12]  
[WASM GitHub][6]  

## Computer science resources (Read it all and you'll know Kung-Fu)  
[Awesome resource about awesome resources][7]  

## WASM looks awesome but C makes me wanna cry. What do ?  
[AssemblyScript][15] is for you: WASM without the hassle of learning a new language  

## asm.js
Old (out of flavor since WASM) and unrelated, but imo it can still be interesting for JS devs trying to get closer to the machine.  
While TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, asm.js is a subset of it. Basically it works with only three data types:  
- int: 32 bit integer type  
- double: 64 bit floating point type  
- float: 32 bit floating point type  

So in the end your application is basically a giant JavaScript array of numbers and pointers to these numbers index. It should give +x% performance over typical, handwritten JS (guess it has to do with Big O and how CPU works, but if you're into this, **please** check the computer science resource above (& Google) instead of my word).  
Afaik esm.js is not meant to be written by hand, but generated by compilers (Emscripten).   Pretty much a precursor of WASM, I like what it does to JS, and the fact that [it can still be written by hand][13].  
But with [the level of masochism involved][14], sane people better learn C and compile into asm.js (for fun) or WASM (for real).

(1): Assuming you're in correct path. `-Wall` will display all Warnings, `foo.c` is target file, `-o foo` will output an executable named `foo`  
(2): `foo.c` is target, `-s` tells *emcc* to generate [LLVM bitcode][16], `WASM=1` WASM=true, `-o foo.html` output an HTML file named foo (could also be `foo.js`)

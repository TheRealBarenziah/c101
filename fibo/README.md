# Fibo or the lulz

Integers will overflow very quickly, so this code is almost meaningless. It's just a base for what's next: 

- Implement a "BigInt" type from scratch in C (`unsigned long long int	` too short for the purpose). NO LIBRARY ALLOWED
- (optional) Store every result in a "dynamic array" (still no lib, I'm here to suffer and it would defeat the purpose)

Long way to go, considering I've not even started playing with pointers yet... See you in 1+ years

... Then I plan to replicate the function in JavaScript ES6 (calculating x terms of Fibo w/ hand-crafted "BigInt" class), see how it is parsed/compiled etc.
